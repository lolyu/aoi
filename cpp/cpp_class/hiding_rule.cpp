/*
the rationale behind `public overloaded non-virtuals call protected non-overloaded virtuals`:

If a public interface has serveral virtual overloads and the derived class writer only override one, the other overloads
that are not overrided will be hiding if users of the derived class try to access those overloads via the derived class.
So the derived class writer should always take care to expose those non-overrided overloads to the derived class via using syntax.

Protected and private virtuals define the classâ€™ customizable behavior.
Public functions defined the class's interfaces, which should be consistent across class inheritance
