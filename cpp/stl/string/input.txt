So far in this book, youâ€™ve seen several examples of console string input. Because the input functions for string objects work with streams and recognize the end-of-file, you can also use them for file input. Listing 16.2 shows a short example that reads strings from the file. It assumes that the file contains strings separated by the colon character and uses the getline() method of specifying a delimiter. It then numbers and displays the strings, one string to an output line.
