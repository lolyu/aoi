# computer system basics

* computer could be simplified into three components:
    * computing unit
    * memory unit
    * connection between computing unit and memory unit

## computing units
* how to measure a computing unit(CPU or GPU)?
    * instruction per second(IPC): number of instructions per cycle
    * clock speed: number of cycles per second

## connection units
* frontside bus: between L1/L2 cache and the RAM
* external bus: between CPU and hardware devices(hard drives and networking cards)
* how to measure a connection unit?
    * bus width: how much data can be moved in a transfer
    * bus frequency: how many transfers can be done per second
