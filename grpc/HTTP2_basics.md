# HTTP/2 basics

* characteristics
    * binary-based instead of text-based
    * mutiplexed
 
* gRPC could work over HTTP/2, Cronet, and in-process.
* HTTP/2 terms
    * HTTP/2, all communications are performed over a single TCP connection that can carry any number of bidirectional flows of bytes
    * stream: a bidirectional flow of bytes within an established connection, a stream can carry one or more messages
    * message: a complete sequence of frames that map to a logical request or response message
    * frame: smallest unit to send/receive over a stream
* relationships of the above terms:
    * All communication is performed over a single TCP connection that can carry any number of bidirectional streams.
    * Each stream has a unique identifier and optional priority information that is used to carry bidirectional messages.
    * Each message is a logical HTTP message, such as a request, or response, which consists of one or more frames.
    * The frame is the smallest unit of communication that carries a specific type of dataâ€”e.g., HTTP headers, message payload, and so on. Frames from different streams may be interleaved and then reassembled via the embedded stream identifier in the header of each frame.

* HTTP/2 summary:
    * In short, HTTP/2 breaks down the HTTP protocol communication into an exchange of binary-encoded frames, which are then mapped to messages that belong to a particular stream, all of which are multiplexed within a single TCP connection.
* in gRPC:
    * gRPC channel represents a HTTP/2 TCP connection
    * each RPC call is a stream
    * a gRPC message is a HTTP/2 message, which might span multiple HTTP/2 frames

    * one TCP connection one HTTP request
